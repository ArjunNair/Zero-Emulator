Using the Emulator
------------------

On the main window you can access the following buttons:
1) Machine - This will pop up a menu allowing you to reset or switch to a different spectrum model.
2) Load - You can load a tape or a snapshot by pressing this button.
3) Monitor - This brings up the Zero Monitor allowing you to debug your programs.
4) Options - The options window allows you to configure Zero in various ways.
5) Tool box - This holds various other functionalities like WoS infoseek program finder, tape browser, cheat helper et al
6) Volume Control - Increase or decrease the sound volume by moving the slider right or left.
7) Power off (red button on the top left) - Shuts down Zero

Right clicking on the emulation window will bring up a context menu that allows you to quickly configure Zero in various ways. 

You can do all these operations via the Options window as well.

-------------------
Using the Keyboard
-------------------
Zero emulates the speccy keyboard faithfully and provides some additional functionality via the PC keyboard.

The Shift Keys on the PC keyboard act as Caps Shift for the speccy, while the Control keys act as Symbol Shift. 
For example, to enter LOAD "" on Zero: First press J to bring up the LOAD keyword and then press Ctrl+P twice (J, Ctrl+P, Ctrl+P).

To enter extended mode press Shift and Ctrl key together.

In addition, you can type in symbols like + , - ? etc directly from the PC keyboard as usual. Of course, the normal speccy entry method will work as well.

If you're in the habit of forgetting what key does what on the speccy (like me!), I recommend you use the SEBasic ROM or the Gosh Wonderful for the 48k, which support full typing (i.e to do LOAD "" you would actually have to type it in one letter at a time like on the PC). 

The following key combinations are used by Zero for its own purpose:

Alt+O   = Open File
Alt+S   = Save snapshot
F5      = Save screenshot
ESC     = Pause Emulation
Alt+F4  = Exit emulator
Alt+0   = 100% window size
Alt++   = Increase window size by 50% of original speccy size
Alt+-   = Decrease window size by 50% of original speccy size
Alt+Enter = Full screen toggle

In full screen mode, Zero shows the menu-bar on the top, which can be hidden by moving the mouse away from the top. To bring it back simply move the mouse back to the top of the screen. The mouse cursor will hide itself automatically after 5 seconds of inactivity

Also, the right-click context menu is available in fullscreen mode as well.

--------------------
Uninstalling Zero
--------------------
Simply run the uninstaller to uninstall the emulator.It's generally a good idea to uninstall a previous version of the emulator before installing a new one.

About Zero

Copyright © 2009 Arjun Nair.

Zero is a spectrum emulator written entirely on the .NET platform, using C#, and requires .NET framework 3.5.

It currently (and probably will continue to!) requires a fairly fast PC to run at true potential. Running on a crappy system will cause sound stutters or severe video lag.
You've been warned! :P

The philosophy behind Zero is to provide a highly accurate emulation of the various Spectrum models while also providing a nice, user friendly experience.

Many thanks to Woody for his patient and detailed technical advice on various aspects of emulation,and to karingal for his help and feedback. This emulator wouldn't have been possible otherwise without their considerable encouragement and support.

I must also thank my wife Purnima for putting up with my obsession with the speccy and even providing encouragement and help with this project!

Thanks also to Patrik Rak for permission to use the various PZX conversion tools that Zero uses to support other tape formats.
